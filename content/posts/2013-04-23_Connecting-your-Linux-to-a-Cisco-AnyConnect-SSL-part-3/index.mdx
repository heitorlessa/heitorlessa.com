Hi there !

This is the final part of using openconnect — You can check the older ones below:

* [**Connecting your Linux to a Cisco AnyConnect (SSL) - Part 1**](http://www.heitorlessa.com/connecting-your-linux-to-a-cisco-anyconnect-ssl-part-1/)
* [**Connecting your Linux to a Cisco AnyConnect (SSL) - Part 2**](http://www.heitorlessa.com/connecting-your-linux-to-a-cisco-anyconnect-ssl-part-2/)

As mentioned previously, we will be covering here **how to create a script to monitor such VPN using ICMP, and restart that VPN if it is down**

I would say, this is very straightforward and does not require much knowledge, so we are going to follow the same procedure as part 2 — Show the script in parts and then a link to the full script will be published at the end.

```bash
# PATH needs to be set as this script will run as a cron job and to protect against basic attacks
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin"

# Global variables
TEST_HOST="yourHost.Here"
STATUS_IF=$(ip addr show | grep "sslinterface" | awk -F: '{print $2}')
COUNT=3
```

As always, we need to define our global variables that will be used along the script. The new thing here is `STATUS_IF` that uses "pipes" to concatenate the previous standard output to a second command, and then a third one.

Basically the `STATUS_IF` will store the whatever interface name you defined previously - can be `tun0`, `sslinterface`, `sslvpn`, etc.

```bash
function check_interface(){
  test -z "$STATUS_IF" && start_openconnect
}

function start_openconnect(){
  /etc/init.d/openconnect start
}
```

The first function `check_interface` will check if our `STATUS_IF` created initially contains anything, otherwise means that there is no VPN interface running, then you can call other function that will start our vpn again ;)

The second one simply calls openconnect init script to start the VPN.

```bash
function check_vpn(){
  if [ $STATUS_IF == "sslinterface" ]
    then
        count=$(ping -c ${COUNT} ${TEST_HOST} | grep 'received' | awk -F',' '{ print $2 }' | awk '{ print $1 }')
        test $count = 0 && /etc/init.d/openconnect restart
  fi
}
```

As our last one, we confirm if the value stored in `STATUS_IF` variable is equals to `sslinterface`, then creates a variable `count` which will store the number of packets received from a `PING` to `TEST_HOST`. This variable uses the same idea of `STATUS_IF`, which we use `VARIABLE=$(command here)` that stores the output of a command in such variable.

So, if the number of packets received is equals to 0 we can assume that our VPN is not working properly OR such `TEST_HOST` is unreachable, then as a result we simply restart the VPN.

However, if the HOST is no longer available in the network, you should define another one (e.g your own gateway) that is able to respond to ICMP packets.

Well, that's all folks!

We finish here the last part of Connecting your Linux to a Cisco AnyConnect VPN !

The next article will be about **SSH Two-Factor authentication**, so it will requires more technical skills than this one to understand some of the tricks to make it work ;)

See you then!
